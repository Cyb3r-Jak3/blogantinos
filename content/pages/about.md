Hey there, fellow data enthusiasts! I'm [Konstantinos](https://ktsoumas.netlify.app), a technophile, with a passion for all things data, machine learning, and software engineering. My captivating journey has traversed diverse domains, from the vibrant hospitality industry to the intricate world of supply chain, always with a singular mission in mind: solving problems from every angle, with an unwavering focus on people. Embracing technology's boundless promise, I stand firm in my conviction to weave a tapestry of convenience and ease in the lives of humanity, while never losing sight of the shadowed perils that accompany progress.

Armed with a mix of academic backgrounds in data science and economics, I'm forever poised to plunge into uncharted problem-solving territories, wielding the mighty sword of data science. I thrive on the adrenaline rush that comes from cracking complex puzzles and unleashing the full potential of data-driven insights. *My secret weapon?* A fusion of statistical sorcery, machine learning wizardry, and a touch of economic wizardry—all meticulously implemented in programming.

*But it's not all work and no play* in my data-driven kingdom. I also have a mischievous side with moments of lighthearted fun to keep the creative juices flowing. I find joy in the simple pleasures of life. Whether it's getting lost in a good book, indulging in movie marathons, embarking on cycling adventures, juggling for fun, playing video games, admiring and even creating modern art, or experimenting in the kitchen, I'm always up for new experiences.

To fuel my creativity, I savor a delightful snack—a peanut butter and banana sandwich—and appreciate the smooth taste of a dark roasted double espresso. Join me on this exciting journey of discovery, where data, technology, and a dash of fun collide to shape a brighter future.
